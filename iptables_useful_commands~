usefull command to watch iptables counters:

watch -d --interval 0 'iptables -nvL | grep -v "0     0"'

This will allow you to watch as matches occur in real-time. To filter out only ACCEPT, DROP, LOG..etc, then run the following command: watch 'iptables -nvL | grep -v "0 0" && grep "ACCEPT"' The -v is used to do an inverted filter. ie. NOT "0 0"
It'll highlight [-d] (with a box over it) any changes since the last refresh.

watch -d --interval 2 'iptables -nvL | grep -v "0     0"'
Induces two second refresh.
